Complete the following 4 Python exercises. Each script is worth 1 point. You must also make a commit for each exercise you complete (4 total), each commit being worth 1 point. Creating your private repository and pushing your commits to that remote is worth 2 points. You may form groups of up to 5; leave your group members' names as a comment at the top of each file so we don't flag you for cheating.
As always, you are encouraged to use any resource available to you, whether that be me, the TAs, the CCI tutoring center, or Google. If you use any of these resources, please leave a comment in your code indicating what the resource is and a link if you found help online. If you copy code from online, please leave a detailed comment explaining what the code does. If we suspect you copied code that you do not understand, we may quiz you and deduct points if you cannot explain your script.
